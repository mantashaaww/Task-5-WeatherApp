This is Task-05 of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

It is a Weather Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter a city name to fetch current weather data including temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed. 

The app includes a demo mode so it works even without an API key, making it easy to view and submit. When a valid OpenWeatherMap API key is added, the app fetches real-time weather data from the API.

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API (optional)
